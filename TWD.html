            <h4 class="subtitle1">Summary</h4>
            <p class="pg1">
                Everyone knows about The Walking Dead and its absurd amount of seasons. The show starts with Rick Grimes 
                waking up in a hospital overrun with zombies, and follows him for another nine seasons as he navigates his 
                way through the zombie apocalypse. There are tons of mini and large arcs to this show, little of which have 
                to do with zombies, and instead revolve around human conflict. The cast of characters grows and shrinks, but 
                we keep most of our main characters and find new and loveable ones along the way.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle2">Why I Like This Show</h4>
            <p class="pg2">
                I like this show for more reasons than I don’t, but I’ll never admit it. I love the characters, and 
                I’ve found my favorites to follow over the years of watching it. I binged the first ten seasons of this 
                show in under three months with my mom, and then the last one as it came out on cable TV, which is an 
                incredibly fast time to have consumed this much zombie content. I like the gore, I like the sense of 
                family, I like the setting, and the characters. It’s also the characters, length, and human conflict 
                that made me question, multiple times, why I continued to watch this show, and why I continue to watch 
                the spinoffs.
