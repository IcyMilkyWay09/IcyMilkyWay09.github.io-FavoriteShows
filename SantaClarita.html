            <h4 class="subtitle1">Summary</h4>
            <p class="pg1">
                This show follows two realtors and their daughter in the Santa Clarita area. When showing 
                a house one random afternoon, Sheila begins literally throwing up all over the house. When 
                her sales partner comes to check on her, it appears she is dead…until she takes a breath. 
                Later in this first episode, Sheila gets hungry, and realizes all she craves is meat, and then 
                alive meat, and then alive humans. The rest of the first season, she and her husband Joel have 
                to find ways to kill people for Sheila to eat, all while they try to keep their daughter from 
                becoming a part of their gruesome new lives. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle2">Why I Like This Show</h4>
            <p class="pg2">
                My mom recommended I watch this, so I had to. I ended up finishing all three seasons in a 
                week. These characters are so real to me, and each one is so different and defined in their 
                own way. I love how they interact with one another, especially how Joel just accepts his wife’s 
                new diet and helps her kill people just so she can eat. I also loved the gore in this show, even 
                if that’s a weird thing to say. 
            </p>
