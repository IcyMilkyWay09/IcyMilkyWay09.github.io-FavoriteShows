            <h4 class="subtitle1">Summary</h4>
            <p class="pg1">
                The Rose family had a fortune from Johnny Rose’s multiple companies, and lived a lavish life with
                private jets and mansions. All of that was taken away in a bad business deal, in which everything was 
                taken but a town Johnny Rose bought as a joke for his son, David. The family has no other choice but 
                to move into this town, where they stay in a motel and try their best to fit in. It becomes clear that 
                these characters have never had to live like ‘regular people’ in their lives, and still wear ridiculous 
                outfits, talk in strange sentences, and tell stories that are just too wild to be made up. As the show 
                goes on, each character begins to grow roots, reluctantly, in this town, and find themselves feeling more 
                and more at home. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle2">Why I Like This Show</h4>
            <p class="pg2">
                I adore this show, and I’ve watched it three times just this year. I have merch and everything. But the 
                reason why I love this show so much is because of the characters, no matter how fancy they talk or how little 
                sense they make. The jokes and lines in this show go well beyond the screen, and they’ve become a staple in my 
                household, down to our coasters. I also really love that this entire show is written by Dan and Eugene Levy, who 
                are father and son in real life and in the show. Other characters in the show are related, and it really builds 
                the sense of family and homeliness in this show.
            </p>
