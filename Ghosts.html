            <h4 class="subtitle1">Summary</h4>
            <p class="pg1">
            In the first episode of the show, Allison and Mike inherit Button House, an old family mansion. 
            Having no other place to go, she and Mike move into this house and begin renovations, with the plan to 
            turn it into a hotel. The two livings are oblivious to the ghosts living in this house, who want these 
            people and their construction crew out. After trying their ghost tricks and powers on the two, they resort 
            to pushing Allison out of an upstairs window. 
            <br >
            After waking from her coma, Allison realizes she can see, hear and interact with the ghosts living in her house. She spends 
            the next few episodes coming to terms with this, with lots of screaming, and realizes that she actually has a gift. Throughout 
            the rest of the show, the ghosts learn more about the living world, and Allison and Mike learn more about the people they live 
            with.

            <h4 class="subtitle2">Why I Like This Show</h4>
            <p class="pg2">
                I originally started watching the American Ghosts series, which is loosely based around this show. I love how each ghost is 
                fleshed out into their own person, and how their stories evolve as the show goes on. Each of these ghosts are so different 
                from one another, and I love them all. Also in the show, the husbands cannot see the ghosts, and have to come to terms with 
                their wives being able to see and talk to these people they cannot. Their acting skills are marvelous and add to the show 
                greatly.
